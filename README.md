## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS


## Description

This webpage contains a simple, yet visually pleasing, animation featuring the phrase "Hello, World!" in English, German and Croatian. In the animation, the phrase is couched in the C# method Console.WriteLine(), and the animation cycles through the three versions while the cursor appears to "type" each phrase quickly before "deleting" it using backspace.

The animation is achieved solely through CSS. No JS is used.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Navigate to https://github.com/rbarcode/hw-css-animation in an internet browser.
2. Click on the green “<> Code” button approximately 2/3s to the right-hand side of the page near the top.
3. On the “Local” tab of the mini-window that opens underneath the “<>Code” button, copy the HTTPS link in the gray bar to your clipboard.
4. In your terminal/shell of choice, navigate to the directory where you wish to download the project and enter the following prompt (replacing the italicized word with the appropriate link): git clone *url-of-the-repository-copied-in-the-previous-step*
5. Your chosen directory will now contain a folder titled “hw-css-animation”.

## Known Bugs

A previous display issue involving the animation appearing beneath the viewable viewport area on some screens was fixed by using vh units in css to position the animation rather than percentages. The animation should now properly display in the center of the page.
